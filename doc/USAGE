To run the included binary (testing only) :

Import my gpg key from the "v/wot/" directory.
`gpg --import v/wot/shinohai.asc`

Verify the nyancoind binary.
`gpg --verify bin/nyancoind.shinohai.asc bin/nyancoind`

Assuming a good signature, run nyancoind.
`LC_ALL=C bin/nyancoind >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`

Logs can be monitored in the usual way.
`tail -f ~/.nyancoin/debug.log`
